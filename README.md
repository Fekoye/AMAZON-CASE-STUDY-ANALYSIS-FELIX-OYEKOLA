## 3 THE RIGOROUS ROAD OF *EXCEL*
üîµ Excel Project: Amazon Product Review Analysis  
*Role:* Excel Analyst 
In this project, I used Excel to clean, analyze, and summarize customer review data from a simulated Amazon product dataset.
*What I Did:*
- Cleaned and transformed raw review data using functions like TEXT(), IFERROR(), VLOOKUP, and TRIM()
- Grouped reviews by rating and product category
- Created dynamic *PivotTables* to show high- and low-rated items
- Designed a simple visual dashboard using slicers and conditional formatting
This project showcases how Excel can be both analytical and visual when used right.
